Architect website with some nice CSS animations.


based on: https://youtu.be/3J-EFMzz94g


I have implemented the following functionality myself:
- when clicking on the items in the sidebar: soft scroll to the according sections on the page and closing the sidebar
- when clicking the Disover Now button: soft scroll to the services section of the page
- adjust the hamburger-color according to the background-color using mix-blend-mode
- on small screens (smaller than 500px): hide hamburger except on the top of the page
- hide the Scroll-Button when at the top of the page
